# Cloud Services

This section evaluates the suitability of cloud services for Truelec by comparing cloud-based virtual machines with traditional on-premise servers. The organisation currently hosts all servers internally, primarily at the headquarters. However, with increasing operational scale and ageing infrastructure, cloud services are being considered as an alternative solution.

The evaluation focuses on replacing the existing servers used for the organisation’s special-purpose booking application. This analysis includes a comparison of cloud virtual machine costs from multiple cloud providers, an assessment of long-term costs over a five-year period, and a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of cloud-based infrastructure compared to purchasing new physical servers.

## Cloud Server Requirements

Truelec operates a booking application that currently requires multiple servers to support its operations. Based on the project scenario, the following server requirements have been identified:

- Three servers are required at the headquarters to support the booking application and related services.
- One server is required at each branch office.
- The organisation operates three branch offices.

This results in a total requirement of six servers. These servers are currently hosted on five-year-old Dell PowerEdge Tower Servers. The organisation is considering whether to replace these servers with new on-premise hardware or migrate them to cloud-based virtual machines.

To support this decision, cloud virtual machine pricing from multiple cloud service providers is evaluated using official pricing calculators. The specifications used for comparison are kept consistent across providers to ensure a fair and accurate cost comparison.
