## Data Privacy and Security Issues

Truelec’s operations involve the collection, storage, and processing of sensitive information related to customers, employees, and organisational activities. As a result, several ethical issues arise concerning data privacy and information security within the proposed network and cloud-based environment.

Customer booking data includes personal information such as names, contact details, and booking records. Customers provide this information with the expectation that it will be handled responsibly and protected from misuse. Ethically, the organisation has a duty to safeguard this data and ensure it is not exposed through poor security practices or inadequate system design. A data breach involving customer information could lead to privacy violations, financial harm, and loss of trust in the organisation.

Employee personal data, including payroll and identification information, also presents significant ethical concerns. Employees are often required to provide sensitive personal details as part of their employment, creating a moral obligation for the organisation to protect this information. Failure to do so could expose employees to identity theft or financial fraud and may damage trust between staff and management.

The use of cloud services introduces additional ethical considerations related to data storage, access, and third-party trust. While cloud platforms offer scalability and reliability, they require careful management of access controls, authentication, and data residency. Ethically, Truelec must ensure that cloud providers are selected responsibly and that appropriate safeguards are implemented to protect data stored outside the organisation’s physical premises.

In addition to privacy concerns, data security failures can have serious legal and social consequences. A data breach may result in regulatory penalties, legal action, and reputational damage. From a social perspective, customers may lose confidence in the organisation, and employees may feel that their privacy has not been respected. This can negatively affect customer relationships, staff morale, and the organisation’s public image.

Management and IT staff have an ethical responsibility to proactively reduce these risks by implementing strong security controls, maintaining compliance with relevant data protection laws, and ensuring that employees are aware of their responsibilities when handling sensitive information. Ethical decision-making in this context involves balancing business efficiency with the duty to protect individuals from harm.

By adopting secure network designs, enforcing strong access control mechanisms, and carefully managing cloud services, Truelec demonstrates a commitment to ethical conduct and responsible data management. This approach supports long-term trust with customers and employees while reducing the likelihood and impact of privacy and security incidents.
