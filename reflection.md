## GitHub Commits

GitHub was used as the primary platform for collaboration and version control throughout the project. All group members regularly committed their work to the shared repository, allowing progress to be tracked transparently and ensuring that individual contributions were clearly recorded.

A screenshot showing the commit history of all team members has been included below to demonstrate active participation and ongoing engagement across the duration of the project.

## List of Tasks

The following table outlines the contributions made by each group member during the completion of Project 1 and Project 2. Tasks were allocated based on individual strengths and project requirements, and all members contributed throughout the duration of the project.

| Student Name | Student ID | Key Contributions |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| Akhil | 12314139 | Contributed to the network design for Project 1, including support with network diagrams and IP addressing. Assisted with cloud services research and reviewed documentation for accuracy and consistency. |
| Mine  | 12315514 | Took primary responsibility for the overall project execution, including detailed network design, cloud services evaluation, cost calculations, and final cloud provider recommendation. Led the cyber security risk assessment, completed the risk assessment spreadsheet, security controls, ethical issues discussion, and coordinated the final documentation and GitHub management. |



## Reflection on Commits and Tasks

GitHub commit history was used to track individual contributions and overall project progress throughout the term. Commits were made consistently during the weeks in which planning, implementation, and documentation activities were carried out.

The student with ID 12315514 made a higher number of commits compared to the other team member. This is because this student took primary responsibility for integrating and maintaining multiple components of the project, including network design documentation, cloud services evaluation, cyber security risk assessment, ethical issues, and overall formatting. Frequent commits were made to reflect incremental updates, revisions, and improvements across several project files.

Akhil (Student ID: 12314139) contributed fewer commits, which reflects the nature of the tasks assigned to him. His contributions focused on specific areas such as assisting with network diagrams, supporting cloud services research, and reviewing documentation. These tasks involved fewer iterative changes, resulting in a lower number of commits while still representing meaningful contribution to the project.

Commits were made across multiple weeks of the term, particularly during the early planning phase, the main implementation phase, and the final review stage. This distribution indicates continuous engagement throughout the project rather than last-minute work.

Overall, the difference in the number of commits is proportional to the scope and type of tasks performed by each student. The commit history accurately represents individual contributions and reflects effective use of GitHub as a collaboration and version control tool.


## Reflection on Group Work

The project was completed through collaborative effort between group members, with tasks allocated based on individual strengths and availability. Regular communication and the use of GitHub for version control supported effective coordination throughout both Project 1 and Project 2.

One of the main challenges encountered during the project was coordinating workloads alongside other academic commitments. At times, progress slowed due to differing schedules, which required flexibility and clear communication to maintain momentum. These challenges were managed by adjusting task allocations and focusing on completing priority components first.

The use of GitHub significantly improved collaboration by allowing work to be completed asynchronously while maintaining visibility of progress. Regular commits and documentation updates helped reduce the risk of version conflicts and ensured that contributions were clearly recorded.

For future projects, improvements could be made by establishing more structured weekly milestones and scheduling regular short check-in meetings to review progress. Earlier clarification of task ownership and deadlines would further improve efficiency and reduce pressure during later stages of the project.

Overall, the group worked effectively to complete the project requirements. The experience reinforced the importance of clear communication, task planning, and consistent use of collaboration tools in successfully delivering technical projects.
