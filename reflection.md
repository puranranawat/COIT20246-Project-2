## GitHub Commits

GitHub was used as the primary platform for collaboration and version control throughout the project. All group members regularly committed their work to the shared repository, allowing progress to be tracked transparently and ensuring that individual contributions were clearly recorded.

A screenshot showing the commit history of all team members has been included below to demonstrate active participation and ongoing engagement across the duration of the project.
