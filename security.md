# 4.3 Cyber Security Risk Assessment

This section presents a cyber security risk assessment for the proposed network design of Truelec. The purpose of this assessment is to identify key assets, threats, and vulnerabilities within the organisation’s network and to evaluate the potential risks associated with cyber security incidents.

The risk assessment conducted in this project is a mini risk assessment, focusing on a subset of steps from a full risk assessment process due to limited time and available information. The assessment follows the risk assessment methodology and template provided in the unit and considers risks across multiple information security threat categories.

## 4.3.1 Risk Assessment Scope

The scope of this risk assessment includes the following components of the organisation:

- Headquarters network infrastructure
- Branch office network infrastructure
- On-premise and cloud-hosted application servers
- Wired and wireless network services
- Organisational data assets, including operational and customer-related data

The assessment considers cyber security risks related to confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets. Both technical and organisational vulnerabilities are taken into account to provide a realistic view of the organisation’s security posture.

## 4.3.2 Risk Assessment Approach

The risk assessment process involves the following steps:

- Identification of key assets across different asset categories
- Identification of potential threats affecting these assets
- Identification of vulnerabilities that may be exploited by threats
- Evaluation of likelihood and impact for each identified risk
- Calculation of overall risk levels using the provided risk assessment template

The results of the risk assessment are documented using a structured spreadsheet, and a Threat–Vulnerability–Asset (TVA) matrix is used to summarise and visualise the identified risks.


## 4.3.3 Asset Identification

The following asset categories have been identified as part of the cyber security risk assessment:

- Hardware assets, including routers, switches, firewalls, and servers
- Software assets, including operating systems and enterprise applications
- Network assets, including wired networks, wireless networks, and VPN connections
- Data assets, including sensitive organisational and customer information
- People assets, including employees, IT administrators, and management staff

## 4.3.4 Data Asset Identification

The following data assets are considered critical to the organisation’s operations and are included in the risk assessment:

- Customer booking data, including customer details and booking records
- Employee personal data, including payroll and identification information
- Financial and accounting data, including invoices and payment records
- Operational project data, including project plans and engineering documentation

## 4.3.5 Threat Categories Considered

The risk assessment considers vulnerabilities across the following information security threat categories:

- Unauthorised access
- Malware and ransomware attacks
- Data breaches or data leakage
- Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
- Insider threats
- Network interception or eavesdropping
- System misconfiguration
- Physical security breaches
